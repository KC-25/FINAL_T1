    <h1>------- Cyber Equinox -------</h1>

    <p id="intro">Welcome detective, the year is 5050 and you work in the city of Silvandraxia. The town is more alive than ever as the cyber equinox approaches, but there have been troubling events leading up to the party. An unknown person has been killing off members of the scientific community and stealing thier technology, but why? You look forward to Professor Mumm's reveal of his mysterious eco chip but worry if he'll be next. It is rumored to be able to save the world, and if you can solve the case it can do just that.</p>

    <p id="voice1"> Nine o'clock already?! I must have blacked out again, I need to get to work. Huh? What's this, I have an unsaved voice mail?</p>
           
    <p id="voicemail">"Hello detective. You've started to interfere with my plans. I hope you know you are weak in comparison to me. You are a spec, a weakling. you've chased me for years, but to no suprise you end up catching your own tail, isn't it troubling. I'm always ahead, and always will be. Be carefull or the people closest to you will die. Don't underestimate me, Detective"</p>

    <p id="voice2">Interfered? His voice was too distorted to recognize, I need to get this to the station and get it analyzed. Then I should go to the party and see how things are going there.</p>
