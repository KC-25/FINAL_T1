    <h1>Cyber Equinox</h1>




    <p id="intro">Welcome detective, the year is 5050 and you work in the city of Silvandraxia. The town is more alive than ever as the cyber equinox approaches, but there have been troubling events leading up to the party. High members of society are showing up missing, informants dead, and cybertronics with missing military level tech. You look forward to Professor Oscarmumm's reveal of his cyrogenic sleeper pods and his myserious eco chip. It is rumored to be able to save the world from the coming appocolipse, but in the wrong hands it can cause it or grant one person absolute power. Prehaps that's the missing piece, the case will take time with your recent black outs and time skips, but why do they want the eco chip. What conects it and why do your memory holes skip the big events.</p>
